# AI-Generated Habit Tracker

A Flutter habit tracking application generated almost entirely through Cursor AI. This project serves as a proof of concept to explore and compare AI code generation tools (Cursor AI vs GitHub Copilot) in real-world application development.

## About This Project

This project was developed as a learning experiment to understand the capabilities and limitations of AI code generation tools, specifically:

- How effectively AI can generate a complete, functional application
- Comparing different AI coding assistants (Cursor AI vs GitHub Copilot)
- Understanding where AI excels and where human intervention is necessary
- Exploring AI's approach to architecture, state management, and UI design
- Testing the boundaries of AI pair programming

## Features

- 📝 Create and manage habits with detailed goals
- 📊 Track progress with customizable metrics
- 🔄 Support for both one-time and recurring habits
- 📅 Set end dates for time-bound goals
- 📈 Visual progress tracking
- 🗑️ Easy data management with local storage
- 🎯 Flexible goal setting with various units and intervals

## AI Development Insights

### Where AI Excels
- Boilerplate code generation
- CRUD operations implementation
- Basic UI components and layouts
- Standard feature implementation
- Database schema design
- State management setup

### Where AI Needs Human Input
- Complex business logic
- Edge cases and error handling
- Performance optimization
- Platform-specific implementations
- Advanced architectural decisions
- Security considerations

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart
- **State Management**: Provider
- **Database**: SQLite
- **UI**: Material Design 3
- **AI Tool**: Cursor AI
